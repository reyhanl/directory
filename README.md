## Installation

## Installation
This app is created in **XCode version 15.0 beta (15A5160n)**. It might not be possible to run it in lower version of XCode, If that is the case please do let me know. 

1. Clone or download zip from https://bitbucket.org/lerepertoire/nawatechtest/src/main/

    > `git clone https://github.com/reyhanl/directory.git`

2. go to project directory

    > `cd insert_project_directory_here`

3. go to project directory

    > `pod install`

4. open `TestNawaTech.xcworkspace`

5. run the project

> If you find your chart in the purchase history page to be flat as I expected it to be, please let me know so I can confirm your order. As the previous sentence might suggest, the chart will only count a completed transaction or you can confirm/finish the order yourself by clicking the cell then finish (I add it for testing purpose).
